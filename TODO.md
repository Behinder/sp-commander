# TODO LIST

1. make some funny 'hello' splash with asci-art
2. implement TiledView to show one maximized stub window with thick borders 
3. implement TiledView to show up to 4 windows/panes
4. stub statusbar
5. stub menubar
6. allow resizing terminal without crashes (getmaxyx() method perhaps before 'refresh')
7. (stub?) methods for listing dirs and files, method for 'touch', delete, etc,

Remember all code should be 64-bit (e.g. use uint64 instead of uint32) compatible and able to compile on amd64 and aarch64.
